Developer Notes:

To get this up and running, please cd into escape-puzzle/backend and run bundle install && rails s
Open another terminal and cd into the escape-puzzle/frontend and run npm install && npm start
Run the Rails server first so that it will run on port 3000 and that the frontend can make the correct fetches
